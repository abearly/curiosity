<a name="task"></a>
## The Task

Your task is to create the functionality described above. You should build upon existing files created/edited in exercises 1 and 2 as well as create new files as necessary.

All AngularJS files should live at `public/js/app` and all template files should be at `resources/views`. The only files that should be changed are

* AngularJS Files
  - `main.js`
  - `app.state.js`
  - `order.controller.js`
- Template Files
  - `admin-angular.blade.php`
  - `home-angular.blade.php`
  - `login.blade.php`
  - `menu.blade.php`
  - `password_modal.blade.php`
  - `product_modal.blade.php`
  - `user_modal.blade.php`
  - `welcome.blade.php`
  - `myaccount.blade.php`

All modal templates can either be used directly or as an example skeleton.

All necessary dependencies, including UI-Router, have already been imported into the HTML, and the module has already been initialized (see resources/views/layouts/application_master.blade.php and resources/views/content.blade.php).

Bootstrap 3 CSS is also included.

The modals and tabs (see admin page) should be created using [UI Bootstrap](https://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/), which has already been imported into the HTML. The skeleton for the tabs has been provided.

Please note that the "Available Products" and "Current Orders" sections of the Admin Page have been switch from lists to tables. This is not required, however, the CSS needed to keep them as lists has **not** been provided.

<a name="instructions"></a>
### Instructions

To complete this task, the following must be done<sup>[1](#fn1)</sup>:

* Create a login page.
  - Create a `login` state with these attributes
    - url: `login`
    - templateUrl: `view/login`
- Add the "welcome" page to the SPA
  - Create a `welcome` state with these attributes
    - url: `/`
    - templateUrl: `view/welcome`
* Create a menu and add it to all pages. This **must** be done using a custom directive.
* Update the Admin Page
  - Update the template in `angular-admin.blade.php`
- Create a "My Account" page
    - Create a `myaccount` state with these attributes
        - url: `/myaccount`
        - templateUrl: `view/myaccount`

The final product should match the sample images and all test cases should be true.

## Important Notes

<a name="angularjs"></a>
### AngularJS
* All AngularJS code should use the [John Papa style guide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/blob/master/a1/README.md)
* If creating new files:
    - Put them in `public/js/app`
    - In order for files to compile automatically with `gulp` or `gulp watch`
      - Controllers should use ".controller.js"
      - Services and/or factories (if used) should use ".service.js"
      - Directives should use ".directive.js"
    - Any other files will needs to be added to `gulpfile.js`. For example, if creating a `app.config.js` file, update to:
    ```javascript
    mix.scripts([
        '../../../public/js/app/main.js',
        '../../../public/js/app/app.state.js',
        '../../../public/js/app/*.controller.js',
        '../../../public/js/app/*.directive.js',
        '../../../public/js/app/*.service.js',
        '../../../public/js/app/app.config.js'
    ], 'public/dist/js/main.js');
    ```
    Run `gulp` or restart `gulp watch` after updating
* Any time a change is made to one of the AngularJS files, you will need to run `gulp` to view the change. This can be prevented by running `gulp watch` prior to starting.

<a name="laravel"></a>
### Laravel

Since this exercise does **not** require Laravel knowledge, the following should be kept in mind:

* Templates, while Blade PHP files, should be normal HTML (see `home-jquery.blade.php`)
* If creating new templates, they should be named using ".blade.php" and should live in `resources/views`
* In order to not conflict with Laravel, start and end symbols have been changed. Use `<%` and `%>` instead of `{{` and `}}` (see [$interpolateProvider documentation](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/provider/$interpolateProvider))

  For example, use `<% vm.variableName %>` instead of `{{ vm.variableName }}`

## Footnotes

<a name="fn1"></a>
[1] Please keep in mind that these are bare-bones instructions and do not include all steps. They do assume that Exercises 1 and 2 are already complete.

<a name="fn2"></a>
[2] Original products should match Exercise 1

<a name="fn3"></a>
[3] By default, two users will exist with the following information. Only Username, Name, and Role should be visible.

| ID | Username   | Name       | Password  | Role  | Token      |
| -- | ---------- | ---------- | --------- | ----- | ---------- |
| 1  | test_user  | Test User  | testuser  | user  | 1k4hd2hf9d |
| 2  | test_admin | Test Admin | testadmin | admin | 9d62hdo39a |

<a name="fn4"></a>
[4] This is to prevent a user from removing/downgrading themselves while logged in
